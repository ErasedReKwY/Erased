Mum died when I was six. I was playing with my toy planes in front of the television, when I heard the thud somewhere above me. Being the curious boy I was at the time, I stopped what I was doing and went to investigate.

It wasn't the aneurysm that actually killed her. It was me. My inaction. See, Mum must have had a terrible pain in her head, like the worst migraine imaginable, and she fell, and she cracked her head off the toilet.

I found her lying there and I pushed at her shoulders and just said 'Mum?' over and over again. Until eventually, I sat there and cried and didn't call an ambulance. Just sat with her, like she did with me when I was poorly. The only actions I took, eventually, were: towels around her head to mop up the blood so Dad wouldn't be mad about the mess; fetching some of my toys so I could play with them in the bathroom as her body went cold.

Dad came home that evening and... I just remember him screaming at me to get out, and seeing him weeping, and running a big palm over Mum's eyes, and then when it came away, Mum's eyes were shut, like he'd put her to sleep.

I still see snapshots in my mind. Subliminal images spliced into my day-to-day melodramas. Not enough change in my pocket to pay for the parking? No problem, I'll just -- Im sitting next to her cold lifeless body with towels dripping with blood on my thighs -- go home and grab a few coins. I meet a hot girl at the coffee shop and smile as she -- Dad, utterly broken, telling me that Mum could have lived, if she'd gotten help sooner -- compliments my hair.

Half a second is all I allow those snap shots to linger for, or else I fall into one of my 'episodes', as my therapist calls them. I force them out of my mind, but they usually tow my momentary happinesses away with them.

Why am I telling you this? I don't know, exactly. It's not relevant to the fact that someone -- something -- is going to kill me. I guess I just wanted to show you what makes me tick. I could have saved her life. 

Now, who am I? you ask. Well, my name is Ben, alias: ReKwY. I do normal stuff, message people on discord, play games on steam, normal stuff. But in a strange way, my life is alot different from other people, since alot changed after the incident.

Now, to the beginning.

I was at school, a run down place in northern England, when one day my mate, Jack, comes into class with a photo in his hands. He walks over to me and takes his usual spot in the classroom next to me. He flashed the photo at me.

"Hey Mate, my Uncle snapped this photo in the woods by the canal, im sort of not meant to show anyone but this is too fucking insane not to show anyone... promise you wont rat, will you?"

He passed me the photo, on it was normal wood scenery and shit. But when I looked closer I could... see something. I pale white figure standing in the distance, it was really tall and I could never seem to look at its face properly. Thats when I noticed something strange...

"What the fuck..." I muttered. "You alright?" Jack said. "I-I need to go to the toilets..." I stuttered, and ran out the classroom, my teacher calling after me. Because the... thing, in the photo.

It was wearing my mums dress.

Story around school was that my PTSD acted up and I had to go home, Dad seems to buy it too, everyone does. Everyone apart from Jack, he saw exactly what was on the photo, and what caused me to run out.

Since then things have gotten... strange, things keep happening around the house, I blink and suddenly an hour went by, my dad is acting weird, spacing out and acting like a robot. Whats been less aparent but more noticable to others was my personality change.

I began to feel Angry, Scared, More Violent, for no reason at all, like when you hate someone, but you have no reason to, but that person is everything.

I started taking it out on people in my life, my friends on a discord group I like talking to, and even my real life friends. Everyone thinks ive gone mad, everyone apart from Jack, of course, he always sticks by me through the highs and lows.

Thats when "They" started appearing, my first experiance with one was a week ago. I woke up at 3am and I really needed the toilet, as I pissed I looked through the window, there standing opposite the street, was a pale white figure, really tall and wearing a dress... I was shocked for a moment and I turned away, but when I looked back, it was gone.

Since then I see them everywhere, behind me in the house, In open doorways at school. The bad thing is, nobody can see them, people think im hallucinating, jumping about 2 feet in the air at seemingly nothing, but I know the truth.

A few days later was the first time I saw multiple of them at once, it was at night, I really needed the toilet but after they appeared I was afraid of the dark so I didnt go to the toilet, I stood up to relieve myself in a bucket i prepared for this situation when i glanced out of the window.

There were 3 of them, just standing there next to eachother, all of their heads raised towards me, suddenly they let off a highpitched screech and disappeared.

The noise continued downstairs in the kitched, i screamed and bariccaded my door in an effort to stop them getting in. Its working, for now but theres no telling how long itll be till those things get in.

Ive been here for 3 days, lucky I was a junk food addict so i survived off of sweets and fizzy alone, but sooner or later im gonna run out. The banging hasnt stopped, nor the screeching, ive got minimal sleep because of it. For now im gonna try and rest, see you when ive woken up.

EDIT: A splinter just fell from my door and onto the floor, oh god those things are managing to break it down. Fuck i dont wanna die.

I dont wanna die

I DONT WANNA DIE

I DONT WAN-
